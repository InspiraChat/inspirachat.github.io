# Chournal Privacy Policy

## Overview

Chournal(original name：Chournal) (hereinafter referred to as "we" or "the App") is a note-taking application designed to help users take notes as if they were chatting with someone. We respect and protect the privacy rights of every user. This Privacy Policy aims to provide detailed information on how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information. Please read the following content carefully before using the App.

## App Description

**Chournal** is an innovative note-taking app that allows you to record life's inspirations and important matters as if you were chatting with someone. It supports seamless use on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, leveraging iCloud cloud services to ensure your data is secure and easily accessible across devices.

## Data Storage and Processing

### Data Storage Location

- **iCloud Storage**: Chournal relies on users' private iCloud space to store all note data. This means your data is directly saved in the iCloud account managed by Apple, not on our servers. Therefore, your notes are not only secure but also occupy your personal iCloud storage space.

### No Account System

- **No Registration or Login Required**: To simplify the user experience and protect user privacy, Chournal does not require users to register or log in to any account. We have not established our own account system, ensuring that your personal identification information is completely separated from your note content.

## AI Features and Data Processing

### AI Service Provider

- **DeepSeek**: We have integrated DeepSeek's AI technology to enhance the user experience, specifically to help users organize fragmented note content, such as generating summaries or organization suggestions.

### AI Data Processing Principles

- **Anonymous Processing**: All data processed through AI features remains anonymous, meaning no information capable of directly identifying the user is involved in the processing.
- **Local Processing (if possible)**: Although current AI features rely on cloud services, we are committed to exploring more advanced local processing options in future versions to reduce data transmission and further enhance privacy protection.

## User Data Collection

### We Do Not Collect User Data

- **Zero Data Collection**: Chournal pledges not to collect, store, or analyze any personal data from users, including but not limited to note content, device information, location data, etc. We firmly believe that your data should solely belong to you.

## Security Measures

- **Relying on iCloud Security Mechanisms**: Leveraging Apple iCloud's robust security mechanisms, including end-to-end encryption, ensures the security of your data during transmission and storage.
- **Regular Reviews**: We regularly review and update our security measures to adapt to evolving privacy protection needs and technological environments.
